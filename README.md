# Slack Status Setter
A faster way to set frequently used slack statuses


## Why?
I change my slack status _a lot_ now that I WFH every day. While it was taking me only ~12s to change my status, doing that a couple times a day added up. Being a developer, I figured I could shorten that time with a bit of code!

## Current State
Right now you can create a status with an emoji, and change you status by double clicking it in the list. It's ugly, the code is a mess, but that's what I managed in 2 hours.

## Upcoming Features
